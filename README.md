# Hidder 📂

Hidder is a **Fabric mod** designed to work in tandem with the [ModSeeker](https://github.com/RAFIN-G/ModSeeker) Paper plugin. It provides secure client-side mod verification, detailed system reporting, and encrypted communication with servers running ModSeeker.

## ✨ Features

* **Client-Side Only**: Runs exclusively on the client; no server-side operations.
* **Comprehensive Mod Detection**: Detects all installed Fabric mods with version information.
* **Resource Pack Detection**: Detects folder-based and ZIP-based resource packs.
* **Shader Pack Detection**: Detects installed shaders.
* **Secure Communication**: Encrypted channels for mod verification with ModSeeker.
* **Native Cryptography**: Uses a native C++ library for RSA/AES encryption and digital signatures.
* **Replay Attack Protection**: Includes timestamps in all signed messages.
* **System Info Reporting**: Sends OS, Java, Minecraft, and Fabric versions to the server.

## 🛠 Requirements

* Minecraft **1.21.10**
* Fabric Loader **0.17.2 or higher**
* Fabric API
* Java **21 or higher**
* Compatible server running **ModSeeker**

---

## 📦 Installation

1.  Install **Fabric Loader** for Minecraft 1.21.10.
2.  Download the latest `Hidder.jar` release.
3.  Place the JAR in your `mods/` folder.
4.  Launch the game.

## 🔗 How It Works

### Connection Process

1.  **Presence Announcement**: Hidder announces itself to the server running ModSeeker.
2.  **Handshake**: Waits for server acknowledgment.
3.  **Mod List Provision**: Responds with a full mod list and system info when requested.
4.  **Encryption**: All communication is encrypted using hybrid RSA/AES.

### Communication Protocol

Hidder uses a custom plugin-channel protocol to communicate with ModSeeker:

| Message Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ANNOUNCE_PRESENCE` | Declares Hidder is installed on the client. |
| `ACKNOWLEDGE_PRESENCE` | Server confirms receipt of announcement. |
| `REQUEST_MODLIST` | Server requests the client's mod list. |
| `RESPONSE_MODLIST` | Client responds with mod list and system info. |

## 🔒 Security Implementation

* **Native Vault**: Uses `hidder_vault.dll` (Windows) / `.so` (Linux) for cryptographic operations.
* **Hybrid Encryption**: RSA public-key encryption secures AES session keys; AES-CBC encrypts payloads.
* **Digital Signatures**: Messages are signed to prevent tampering.
* **Replay Protection**: Timestamps included in all signed messages.
* **Payload Verification**: Server validates signatures and timestamps before accepting data.

## 💻 Native Library

Hidder’s native library provides:

* RSA/AES hybrid encryption
* High-performance signature generation
* Automatic runtime extraction and loading

> **⚠️ Warning:** Do not modify the native library; any changes will invalidate communication with ModSeeker.

## 🛠 Building from Source

### Prerequisites

* Visual Studio with C++ tools (for Windows native compilation)
* OpenSSL development libraries
* JDK 21+
* Gradle

### Steps

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3. **🔑 Client Keys**
To build the client, you need the keys generated by the server:
* Obtain `CLIENT_KEYS_CPP.txt` (generated by the [ModSeeker](https://github.com/RAFIN-G/ModSeeker/tree/main/Tools) server tools).
* Paste its contents into `native/hidder_vault.cpp`, replacing the `RSA KEY COMPONENTS` section.
4.  **Compile the native library (Windows):**
    ```bash
    native/compile_vault.bat
    ```
5.  **Build the JAR:**
    ```bash
    ./gradlew build  # Linux/macOS
    gradlew.bat build # Windows
    ```
The compiled JAR will appear in `build/libs/`.
